# Diabetes ML Prediction

**Business Problem**
It is desired to develop a machine learning model that can predict whether people have diabetes when their features are specified. Before developing the model, you are expected to perform the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps.

**Dataset Story**

The dataset is part of a larger dataset held at the National Institutes of Diabetes-Digestive-Kidney Diseases in the US. In the US Pima Indian women aged 21 years and older living in Phoenix, the 5th largest city in the State of Arizona are the data used for diabetes research.

The target variable is specified as **"outcome"**, where 1 indicates a positive diabetes test result and 0 indicates a negative result.

* **Pregnancies:** Number of pregnancies

* **Glucose:** 2-hour plasma glucose concentration in oral glucose tolerance test

* **Blood Pressure:** Blood Pressure (small blood pressure) (mm Hg)

* **SkinThickness:** Skin Thickness

* **Insulin:** 2-hour serum insulin (mu U/ml)

* **DiabetesPedigreeFunction:** Function (2-hour plasma glucose concentration in oral glucose tolerance test)

* **BMI:** Body mass index

* **Age:** Age (years)

* **Outcome:** Have the disease (1) or not (0)
